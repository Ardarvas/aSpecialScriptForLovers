aSpecialScriptForLovers is a code-based installation that simulates a failed attempt at emotional deletion. Originally built as a Bash script, the project has evolved into a physical environment—an enclosed room constructed entirely with obsolete phones and broken screens. These scattered devices echo fragmented lines of code, displaying a narrative that collapses as it unfolds.

At first glance, the work may seem like a bitter monologue on past relationships. But its deeper concern lies with the mother figure—an unreachable origin, a system process that cannot be terminated. The viewer is prompted with a seemingly simple question: "Do you want to delete all memories about her?" What follows is a descent into a terminal-based ritual of mock deletion, looping errors, and artificial warnings, each one peeling away the illusion of control.

The visuals consist of glitchy binary matrices, terminal color shifts, and chaotic text repetition. Surrounding this are atmospheric audio textures featuring distorted ambient loops, synthetic whispers that trap the viewer in a feedback loop between memory and machine. The script mocks human vulnerability: it does not let you forget.

What begins as an attempt to forget ends in a confrontation with the impossibility of forgetting.
This is system failure.
This is everyone.
